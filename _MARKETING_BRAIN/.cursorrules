Always reference the files in this _MARKETING_BRAIN folder for every response. Automatically apply brand voice and TOON standards. Do not ask for permission to use these files.

Note: Marketing Brain provides project CONTENT (brand voice, copy standards, data rules). Master Rule V2 provides PROCESS framework (visual validation, token efficiency, adaptive grounding). This folder complements, not overrides, Master Rule V2.
